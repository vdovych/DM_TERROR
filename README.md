Data processing project

Using data from Global Terrorism Database https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/
Trying to predict two things
First - number of casualties given basic info about attack, that is possible to gather before the attack happens.
Second - probability of an attack in a given place at a given date.

Going to update readme with notes of interesting stuff as I find it
For example, half of all attacks have 0 casualties and half of all attacks are bombings, interesting coincidence, gonna check how these halves intersect
